This program uses a **GPT-2** model from the **Transformers** library to generate text based on a given prompt. It handles missing libraries gracefully by displaying an error message if **Transformers** is not installed. Users can customize the model, output length, number of generated sequences, and random seed for reproducibility. The input parameters are validated to ensure positive values. Generated text is printed sequentially, and errors during the process are caught and displayed. This design allows flexible text generation while handling common runtime issues efficiently.
